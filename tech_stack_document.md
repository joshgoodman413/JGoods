# TechTrek Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices behind TechTrek, our educational platform aimed at helping non-technical professionals build foundational tech literacy. Below you will find a clear explanation of our tech stack, including frontend, backend, deployment, integrations, security, and more. We use everyday language to ensure that everyone, regardless of technical background, can understand our decisions.

## Frontend Technologies

The frontend is what the users interact with directly on their mobile devices. Our primary aim here is to create an engaging, fluid, and easy-to-use experience that mimics popular interactive learning apps like DuoLingo.

*   **React Native (with TypeScript)**:

    *   Enables us to create mobile applications for both iOS and Android using a single codebase.
    *   TypeScript adds an extra layer of reliability by catching errors early, ensuring that the user interface (UI) works smoothly and is easy to maintain.

*   **Styling and Design Considerations**:

    *   We use our brand colors (blue, green, and gray) throughout the interface to maintain a consistent and modern look.
    *   The design emphasizes clarity and interactivity, with elements like drag-and-drop, fill in the blank, multiple choice, matching, and tap-to-build challenges integrated into every lesson.

*   **Additional Frontend Tools and IDE Integrations**:

    *   **Lovable.dev**: Assists in generating both front-end components and full-stack web apps with AI-powered insights, ensuring our design remains modern and intuitive.
    *   **V0 by Vercel**: Facilitates quick prototyping of frontend components using modern design patterns.
    *   **Cursor** & **Windsurf**: Advanced IDEs that provide integrated AI coding capabilities to help streamline our development process.
    *   **VS Code**: Our trusted code editor that integrates well with all our tools and ensures a seamless coding experience.

## Backend Technologies

The backend is the engine that powers TechTrek, handling user data, content, learning progress, and interactions behind the scenes.

*   **Supabase**:

    *   **Supabase Database**: Stores all user data, lesson content, quiz results, progress metrics, and more.
    *   **Supabase Authentication**: Manages user sign-up, login, and secure session handling with email-based authentication.
    *   **Supabase Storage**: Handles the storage of lesson assets, including images, quizzes, and any downloadable content for offline usage.

*   **API and Data Layer**:

    *   Our backend communication is managed through APIs that allow the frontend to fetch data, update progress, and interact with the database securely.
    *   This integration ensures that the interactive lessons, gamification, and real-time progress tracking work seamlessly together.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Our infrastructure choices ensure that TechTrek is reliable, scalable, and easy to update.

*   **Mobile Platforms**:

    *   We deploy our application on both iOS and Android platforms to reach a wide audience.

*   **Hosting & Deployment Tools**:

    *   Supabase acts as our backend hosting service, managing both the database and storage.
    *   Our CI/CD pipelines utilize integrated development tools and services like Lovable.dev and Vercel’s V0 which streamline our component building, ensuring rapid yet reliable updates.

*   **Version Control**:

    *   We use established version control systems that integrate with our IDEs (VS Code, WindSurf, and Cursor) to keep track of every change and allow for collaborative work.

## Third-Party Integrations

TechTrek leverages a number of third-party tools to enhance functionality and improve the overall user experience.

*   **Educational and Gamification Integrations**:

    *   **AI-powered Chatbot**: A lesson hint feature is powered by AI (using tools like GPT 4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) to provide real-time guidance whenever users need assistance.
    *   **Progress Analytics**: Integrated tools like Mixpanel or Firebase Analytics (planned for future updates) track user engagement, lesson completion rates, and quiz performance to continuously improve the learning experience.
    *   **Gamification Components**: In addition to XP points and streaks, badges and leaderboards are planned to encourage friendly competition and reward milestones.

*   **Admin Interface & Content Management**:

    *   A dedicated admin interface is built to allow for easy updates, content management (lessons, quizzes, and notifications), and user feedback review. This ensures that the learning content remains fresh and interactive.

*   **Future Integrations**:

    *   Calendar syncing for lesson scheduling, advanced AI recommendations for personalized learning, and further analytics tools are on our roadmap to further refine the personalized learning experience.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security and performance are critical for providing a smooth and safe learning environment.

*   **Security Measures**:

    *   Secure user authentication via Supabase Authentication ensures ownership and privacy of user data.
    *   Data protection protocols safeguard user progress, personal settings, and sensitive information.
    *   Regular updates and careful integration of third-party services ensure that new vulnerabilities are minimized.

*   **Performance Optimization**:

    *   The use of React Native ensures smooth animations and rapid load times.
    *   Offline functionality is implemented (using local storage in React Native) which allows lessons and quizzes to be accessed even without a continuous internet connection.
    *   Caching of essential lesson content minimizes load times and ensures seamless progress synchronization once connectivity is restored.
