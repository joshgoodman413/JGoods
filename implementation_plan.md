# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. **Prevalidation:** Check if the current directory is already a TechTrek project (e.g., look for a `package.json` or existing project config). *(Project Requirements Document)*
2. **Validate Node.js Installed:** Run `node -v` to ensure Node.js v20.2.1 is installed. If not, install Node.js v20.2.1. *(Tech Stack Document)*
3. **Validate React Native Environment:** Confirm that the React Native CLI is installed. If missing, install it via `npm install -g react-native-cli`. *(Tech Stack Document)*
4. **Create Project Directory Structure:** If not already initialized, create the base project directory (e.g., a new folder named `TechTrek`). *(Project Requirements Document)*
5. **Cursor (AI-powered IDE) Configuration:**
   - Check if you are using Cursor as your IDE.
   - Create a `.cursor` directory in the project root if it doesn’t exist. *(Tech Stack Document)*
6. **Create Cursor Metrics File:** Inside the project root, create a file named `cursor_metrics.md` to track metrics. Refer to `cursor_project_rules.mdc` for details. *(IDE: Cursor instructions)*
7. **Configure MCP for Supabase in Cursor:**
   - Inside the `.cursor` directory, create a file named `mcp.json` if it does not exist.
   - Add the following configuration placeholder based on your OS:
     - **macOS:**
       ```json
       { "mcpServers": { "supabase": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "<connection-string>"] } } }
       ```
     - **Windows:**
       ```json
       { "mcpServers": { "supabase": { "command": "cmd", "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "<connection-string>"] } } }
       ```
   *(Tech Stack Document)*
8. **Provide Connection String Instruction:** Display the link for obtaining a Supabase connection string:
   > https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp#connect-to-supabase-using-mcp
   After you obtain the connection string, replace `<connection-string>` in the configuration. *(Tech Stack Document)*
9. **Validate MCP Connection (Cursor):** Navigate to Settings/MCP in Cursor and verify that the server shows a green active status after connection. *(Tech Stack Document)*

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

10. **Initialize React Native Project:** Run `npx react-native init TechTrek --template react-native-template-typescript` in the project root to create a TypeScript-based React Native app. *(Project Requirements Document, Tech Stack Document)*
11. **Validate Project Creation:** Confirm that a new React Native project (folders like `/ios`, `/android`, and `/src`) is created.
12. **Implement User Authentication Screens:** Create `LoginScreen.tsx` and `SignupScreen.tsx` in `/src/screens/` to manage email-based sign-up and sign-in. *(Project Requirements Document)*
13. **Create Dashboard Screen:** In `/src/screens/`, create `Dashboard.tsx` to display progress (completed lessons, XP, streaks, badges, leaderboards). *(Project Requirements Document, App Flow Document)*
14. **Develop Lesson Screen:** In `/src/screens/`, create `LessonScreen.tsx` to display interactive lessons. Ensure content supports various formats like drag-and-drop, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, matching, and tap-to-build. *(Project Requirements Document)*
15. **Develop Quiz Screen:** In `/src/screens/`, create `QuizScreen.tsx` that enforces quiz attempts (retake required after 2 failed attempts). *(Project Requirements Document)*
16. **Setup Navigation:** Use React Navigation (install if necessary) to route between Login, Signup, Dashboard, Lesson, and Quiz screens. *(App Flow Document)*
17. **Integrate Gamification UI Components:** Design and implement UI components (using the blue, green, and gray color palette) for XP, streaks, badges, and leaderboards. *(Project Requirements Document, Branding & Design)*
18. **Implement Offline Caching:** Use a library like redux-persist or AsyncStorage to cache lessons and quizzes for offline access in `/src/utils/offlineCache.ts`. *(Project Requirements Document, Important Considerations)*
19. **Integrate Mobile Notifications:** Set up local notifications (using React Native libraries such as `react-native-push-notification`) to send daily reminders and milestone alerts. *(Project Requirements Document)*
20. **Validation:** Run the app in an emulator (iOS and/or Android) and verify navigation and UI elements function correctly.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

21. **Set Up Supabase Project:** Log into your Supabase account and create a new project for TechTrek. *(Tech Stack Document)*
22. **Obtain Connection String:** Retrieve the Supabase connection string from the dashboard using the provided link: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp#connect-to-supabase-using-mcp. *(Tech Stack Document)*
23. **Configure MCP with Supabase:** Verify that the `<connection-string>` in your `.cursor/mcp.json` configuration is updated with the actual connection string. *(Phase 1, Tech Stack Document)*
24. **Design Database Schema:** Define PostgreSQL tables (PostgreSQL version used in Supabase) for:
   - Users: (id, email, password hash, etc.)
   - Lessons: (id, title, content, sequence order, etc.)
   - Quizzes: (id, lesson_id, questions, answers, etc.)
   - Progress: (user_id, lesson_id, status, XP, streaks, badges)
   - AdminContent: (content updates, user feedback, etc.)
   *(Project Requirements Document, Tech Stack Document)*
25. **Create Database Schema in Supabase:** Using the Supabase SQL editor or migration tool, execute SQL scripts to create the above tables and set up proper relations. *(Backend & Storage: Supabase)*
26. **Develop Authentication Endpoints:** Leverage Supabase’s built-in authentication for email sign-up/in. No extra coding is required unless custom endpoints are needed. *(Project Requirements Document)*
27. **Develop Lesson & Quiz Endpoints:** Create RESTful endpoints in a serverless function or a lightweight Node.js backend (if required) to fetch lessons, quizzes, and update progress. Place code in `/backend/api/`. *(Project Requirements Document, App Flow Document)*
28. **Implement AI Chatbot Endpoint:** Develop an endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/v1/chatbot`) which communicates with AI models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) to provide hints and guidance. *(Project Requirements Document, AI Integration)*
29. **Validation:** Test backend endpoints using tools like Postman or `curl` (e.g., `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/chatbot`) and ensure they return the expected data.

## Phase 4: Integration

30. **Integrate Frontend with Backend:** In `/src/services/api.ts`, set up API calls (using `fetch` or `axios`) to interact with Supabase endpoints for authentication, lesson retrieval, quiz submissions, and progress updates. *(App Flow Document)*
31. **Integrate AI Chatbot in Frontend:** Create a component (e.g., `Chatbot.tsx` in `/src/components/`) that sends user queries to the chatbot endpoint and displays hints/guidance. *(Project Requirements Document, AI Integration)*
32. **Link Mobile Notifications to Backend Events:** Ensure that notifications (e.g., quiz results, milestone achievements) are triggered based on data received from backend events. *(Project Requirements Document)*
33. **Integrate Analytics:** Add integration for Mixpanel or Firebase Analytics in `/src/utils/analytics.ts` to track user engagement and gather feedback. *(Important Considerations)*
34. **Validation:** Run end-to-end tests by simulating a full user flow: account creation, lesson participation, quiz submission, chatbot interaction, and checking that progress is recorded in Supabase.

## Phase 5: Deployment

35. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:** Configure a CI/CD workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests and build your React Native app. Create a pipeline configuration file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). *(Tech Stack Document, Deployment)*
36. **Deploy Supabase Backend:** Ensure that your Supabase project is set to production and all database migrations are applied. *(Tech Stack Document)*
37. **Build Mobile App for iOS:** Use Xcode to build the iOS version of the app and prepare for App Store submission. *(Project Requirements Document)*
38. **Build Mobile App for Android:** Use Android Studio to build the Android version of the app and prepare for Google Play submission. *(Project Requirements Document)*
39. **Configure Analytics in Production:** Double-check that Mixpanel or Firebase Analytics is correctly set up in the production build to monitor user engagements. *(Important Considerations)*
40. **Set Up Crash Reporting:** Integrate a crash reporting tool (if desired) to catch and report errors post-deployment. *(Project Requirements Document)*
41. **Validation:** Run post-deployment smoke tests on both iOS and Android builds to ensure that all features (login, lessons, quizzes, chatbot, notifications) work seamlessly.
42. **Monitor Performance:** Ensure that lesson load times and quiz feedback remain within the 2-3 second target as per performance requirements. *(Project Requirements Document, Important Considerations)*
43. **Review Security Settings:** Confirm that HTTPS is enforced, and robust authentication via Supabase is active. *(Project Requirements Document, Q&A: Security)

*Note:* Throughout the process, continuously cross-reference the Project Requirements Document, App Flow Document, and Tech Stack Document to ensure all specifications are met. Prioritize redundancy checks and validate at each integration point to maintain a smooth user experience for the non-technical audience of TechTrek.
