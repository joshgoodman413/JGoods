# TechTrek App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first launches TechTrek, they are greeted by a clean and welcoming landing screen that highlights the modern color scheme of blue, green, and gray. This initial screen offers a clear choice between signing in and signing up. For users who are new to the platform, the registration process is streamlined using email sign-up. The user is guided through simple steps to provide their email address, create a secure password, and select their preferred notification time along with offline capability options to ensure seamless access to lessons even when connectivity is limited. For returning users, the sign-in page is straightforward with fields for email and password. In addition, there is a clearly visible link for recovering lost passwords which directs users to a password reset flow where they can securely update their credentials via a confirmation email. Although the primary method is email sign-up, the structure also allows for future integrations of additional social logins to further simplify the process. Once the credentials are successfully verified, users are promptly signed in and the app synchronizes any locally saved data with the central database in Supabase.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful sign-in, users are taken to the main dashboard which serves as the heart of the TechTrek experience. The homepage provides an introduction to the platform and reinforces its educational mission. Users see an inviting overview that includes their current progress highlights such as XP points, current streaks, and recently completed lesson summaries. A visually engaging header welcomes users and a central call-to-action prompts them to either continue with their current learning path or to start new topics. The interface is uncomplicated with a navigation menu that clearly directs users to areas like the Learning Path, Progress Dashboard, and Profile Management. This organization ensures that movement between key sections feels natural and that important gamification elements such as badges and leaderboards are immediately visible to incentivize regular engagement.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Once on the Learning Path page, users are presented with a curated list of topics organized into categories such as Basics, Binary, and Operating Systems. Each topic is displayed with visual progress bars that indicate lesson completion status along with short descriptions of the content. When a user selects a topic, they are transitioned to the Lesson Screen which is designed to deliver educational content in interactive, game-like formats. Lessons are short, under ten minutes, and include various types of interactive exercises like drag-and-drop puzzles, fill in the blank activities, tap-to-build challenges, multiple choice questions, and matching games. Every page within a lesson also includes a clearly marked hint button that, when pressed, connects the user to an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide timely assistance and clarifications. Following the interactive content, users are taken to the Quiz Screen which assesses their understanding of the lesson material. Feedback is given immediately upon completion. Should a user fail to achieve the passing mark after two attempts, the flow directs them back to the lesson content with recommendations to review specific segments before retrying the quiz. In cases where users score exceptionally well (for example, achieving 90% or above), the app offers the flexibility to skip ahead within the same category, thus accommodating both beginners and those with prior experience. Throughout these transitions, navigation options remain visible so that users can return to previous lessons, switch to another topic, or view their overall progress at any time.

## Settings and Account Management

TechTrek offers a dedicated Profile Management page where users can review and update their personal information, change their password, and adjust notification preferences. Within this section, users have control over the timing and types of push notifications they receive, including daily reminders, milestone achievements, and immediate feedback on quiz results. In addition, features such as offline functionality settings allow users to decide how much content is cached locally. For users who require billing or subscription management, these settings are integrated into the profile as well, offering a straightforward path to update credit card information and review subscription status. Once modifications are made, users can easily navigate back to the main dashboard or other learning elements without any interruption to their study flow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

At any point during the userâ€™s journey, TechTrek is designed to gracefully handle error states or unexpected actions. If a user inputs invalid data during sign-up or profile updates, the system immediately displays clear, concise error messages that help guide them to correct the mistake. In the event that a user loses connectivity, the app seamlessly transitions to offline mode by relying on locally cached lesson content and quizzes, allowing the user to continue learning. Once the connection is restored, synchronization occurs automatically to update progress. Any restricted actions, such as attempting to access premium content without proper authorization, result in informative alerts that provide the next steps or redirect the user to a subscription upgrade screen. These error handlers and fallback pages maintain consistency, ensuring that every interruption is resolved quickly and that the overall learning journey remains intact.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

In summary, TechTrek offers a holistic educational experience that guides a non-technical professional from the moment they first sign up through to daily engagement with interactive lessons. The journey starts with an easy-to-navigate onboarding process where users set up their account and preferences, followed by a well-organized main dashboard that serves both as a starting point and a progress tracker. Detailed feature flows ensure that the learning path, interactive lessons, and immediate quiz feedback create a structured yet flexible curriculum. Gamification elements such as XP points, badges, leaderboards, and rewards serve to motivate users as they build foundational tech knowledge. The app also incorporates robust settings for account management, comprehensive error handling to secure a fluid experience, and offline capabilities to ensure learning is never interrupted. In this way, TechTrek not only educates but also continually inspires users to deepen their tech literacy and confidently interact with technical teams in their professional environment.
