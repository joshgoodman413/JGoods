# TechTrek Security Guidelines Document

This document outlines the security guidelines that must be adhered to for the TechTrek educational platform. TechTrek is designed to empower non-technical professionals with essential technology knowledge in a fun and interactive manner. Below are the key security considerations and measures for ensuring a robust, secure, and trustworthy application.

---

## 1. Data Transmission

- **HTTPS Enforcement:**
  - All user data, including lesson progress, credentials, and personal information, must be transmitted over secure HTTPS channels.
  - TLS (Version 1.2 or higher) must be used to secure data in transit.

---

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

- **Robust Authentication:**
  - Use Supabase's authentication mechanisms to enforce robust user identity management.
  - Ensure email verification as part of the sign-up flow.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Differentiate permissions between regular users and administrative accounts.
  - Ensure that every API endpoint performs proper server-side authorization checks.

---

## 3. Data Protection & Privacy

- **User Data Protection:**
  - Adhere to privacy standards and regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Offline Data Security:**
  - Implement encryption for any sensitive data cached offline (e.g., lessons, quizzes).
  - Ensure that offline storage mechanisms comply with internal security policies.

---

## 4. API & Service Security

- **API Communication:**
  - Secure all API endpoints used for communication between the front end (React Native) and the Supabase backend.
  - Employ rate limiting and input validation to prevent brute force and injection attacks.

- **Input Validation:**
  - Validate all user and system inputs to prevent common vulnerability exploits such as injection attacks.

---

## 5. AI Chatbot Security

- **Secure AI Interactions:**
  - Ensure that all AI components (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) properly validate and sanitize inputs.
  - Prevent any sensitive data leakage or injection attacks through careful handling of user inputs on AI-powered features.

---

## 6. Admin Interface Security

- **Restricted Access:**
  - Protect the admin interface/CMS with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
  - Implement auditing and logging for all administrative actions to track changes and potential security breaches.

---

## 7. Mobile Application Security

- **Mobile Best Practices:**
  - Apply mobile security measures such as code obfuscation to protect against reverse engineering.
  - Enable secure storage and handling of user data to prevent exploitation from local vulnerabilities.

---

## 8. Dependency Management

- **Regular Updates:**
  - Maintain and regularly update all dependencies including third-party libraries and frameworks.
  - Use lock files (e.g., package-lock.json, yarn.lock) and automated scanning tools to identify and respond to vulnerabilities.

---

## 9. Regular Security Audits

- **Audits & Penetration Testing:**
  - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.
  - Ensure that any discovered weaknesses are promptly remediated.

---

## 10. Incident Response

- **Preparedness:**
  - Develop and maintain an incident response plan to quickly address security breaches or data incidents.
  - Establish a clear communication channel to notify users and stakeholders in the event of a security incident.

---

## 11. User Education

- **Security Best Practices for Users:**
  - Educate users on creating strong passwords and recognizing phishing attempts.
  - Provide regular updates and guides on maintaining personal account security.

---
